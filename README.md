# html-prototype

Create a landing page for a fictional travel agency that promotes destinations and services. The page should include:
1. HTML Structure
A header with the agency name and navigation bar (Home, Destinations, Packages, Contact).
A hero section with a background image and tagline (e.g., “Explore the World With Us”).
A destinations section with 3–4 featured places, each displayed in a card with an image, title, and short description.
A packages section with pricing tables (e.g., Basic, Premium, Luxury).
A footer with contact info and social media links.
2. CSS Styling
Use a vibrant color palette (e.g., sky blue, white, and accent colors like orange or green).
Style the navigation bar with hover effects.
Add shadows and rounded corners to destination cards.
Style pricing tables with borders, spacing, and highlighted “best value” package.
3. CSS Animations
Animate the hero tagline to fade in and zoom slightly on page load.
Animate destination cards to lift when hovered.
Add a smooth hover transition effect to pricing tables (e.g., highlight border color).
4. Tailwind CSS
Use Tailwind utility classes for layout, spacing, colors, and typography.
Make the destination cards responsive (grid layout on desktop, stacked on mobile).
Add a Tailwind-styled “Book Now” button under each package.

WanderList Agency: Explore the World With Us
Brand Identity & Navigation The experience begins with a clean, sticky header featuring the WanderLust logo in vibrant sky blue. A minimalist navigation bar allows users to glide between "Home," "Destinations," "Packages," and "Contact" with elegant hover effects that highlight each link in soft azure.

The Hero Experience The centerpiece is a breathtaking hero section showcasing a high-definition mountain landscape. Upon loading, the tagline "Explore the World With Us" smoothly fades in and zooms toward the viewer, creating an immediate sense of motion and adventure.

Curated Destinations Further down, a grid of responsive cards highlights three premier locations: the tropical Maldives, romantic Venice, and the ethereal landscapes of Iceland. Each card is styled with soft shadows and rounded corners; when a user hovers over a destination, the card gently lifts, mimicking a physical interaction.

Tailored Travel Packages The "Packages" section offers three distinct tiers—Basic, Premium, and Luxury—presented in sleek pricing tables.

The Premium package is highlighted as the "Best Value" with a striking orange border and a subtle scale increase to catch the eye.

Each table features a bold, Tailwind-styled "Book Now" button, turning a smooth hover into a bright call to action.

Contact & Socials The journey concludes in a charcoal-gray footer, providing essential contact details and social media links. It offers a grounded, professional finish to a page designed to inspire wanderlust through modern aesthetics and fluid motion.
